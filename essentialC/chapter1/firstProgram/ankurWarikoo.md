One of my mentees is 3 years into his first job, wondering if it's the right time to quit or if he should continue.

I asked him what he wanted to do.

"I don't know. If I stick to the job, I will gain expertise and build skills.
But I am not really happy here - so I am not sure if continuing here helps or not.
Plus, I do not know what else I could do. What will be the right thing to do?"

I asked him again.
"What do you want to do?"

"Oh, I don't know. I haven't been very deliberate about my career until now.
I did not plan for it. I just landed into it.
I see my friends - like this girl I know who always wanted to be in academics and is pursuing that. She is so clear on what she should do.
I am not."

I asked him one final time.
"What do you want to do?"

"I have told you I do not know what I should do."

That right there is the problem.

I am not asking you what you should do.
I am not asking you what is the right thing to do.
I am asking you - what do you WANT to do?

3 questions to help you get clarity on what you want to do:

1. What are the things that I WANT to do?​

Do not think of whether you will get it, whether it's the right thing for the future, or whether you are qualified.
No constraints.
Just a list of all the things you want to do.

2. What is stopping me?​

This is where the constraints are listed.
It could be your capability, it could be your parent's permission, it could be lack of opportunities, or it could be the fact that it doesn't make enough money.
It could just be your mind tricking you that you can't do it.

3. Which of these are in my control to fix?​

THIS is the clincher.
This is where you transfer control - from the world to yourself.
YOU ARE IN CHARGE.
Not your circumstances, your family, or the world.

You will realise that there are only so many things in your control.

BUT if you were to take control of them - you will actually be ahead of most people in the same boat who want to do the same thing but never start.

Are you going to try this?
